A sequence is an ordered arrangement of items, events, or numbers where the order is crucial.

when creating a sequence in the microservice world, we want to get a instant result, and reliable and ordered sequence.

if the result service is terminated or crashed, we want to recover the last sequence, so it doesn't start over from the start.

so we will built an application or a service with this specs

- application in go language, we will use a channel and go routine for get instant sequence, and preserving a next sequence value
- sqlite3, to save a sequence value, and restore a sequence value if the application is restarted or crashed
- go server for getting an sequence
- we test it through unit test and e2e test
